Don\u2019t doubt the determination of Melbourne\u2019s sporting public to top that tonight. And if you\u2019re at home wondering if there is still room <em><strong>there is</strong>. </em>Additional standing room tickets were released today. Part of what makes the MCG so special are the standing room bays, so don\u2019t let that dissuade you. I\u2019m experiencing some pretty fierce FOMO from the other side of the world, make no mistake.

Especially if Australia made it. Compare that to three years ago when the goal to pack out Lord\u2019s was put out there the ODI World Cup and it was laughed at it some quarters. As history shows, HQ was at capacity that day and the wonderful word from Melbourne this evening is that <strong>the World Record is every chance to go tonight. <br></strong></p> <p>Talk about a big three years - indeed, a massive five years - for the women\u2019s game around the world. The promise of the massive investment had been realised long before now but this International Women\u2019s Day moment truly is something else. And it\u2019s the dream final for tournament organisers too, the hosts and defending champions up against their nemesis India. Everything about this is huge. <br></p> <p>Stick with the OBO as we preview the match while keeping an eye on what I am certain will be a spectauclar pre-game show with Katy Perry.

Yet with me it is always seed.</p> <p>I am determined this year to face it: my demon of addiction. So today I spent three hours gathering bags and packets of seed, scattered throughout the house; in the kitchen, living room, bedroom, in bowls and boxes. First, sorting them into manageable types: \u2018fruit\u2019, such as beans, peas, squash and courgettes; \u2018leaf\u2019, which were mainly assorted salads and cooking greens; \u2018root\u2019, such as radishes and beetroots of assorted hues; and \u2018flower\u2019 \u2013 crazed amounts of nasturtiums, tagetes, calendula and poppies. There is even a special category for Italian chicories.</p> <p>I discard anything much out of date. I do this most years, but still find a dozen or more dating back to 2012. I am almost ruthless. I nearly fill a bin. But somehow I can\u2019t bring myself to throw the Wild Garden Seed from Oregon, some in 1 oz packets of seasonal salad mixes and beautiful beet leaves \u2013 this for a piece of land not much bigger than a bedroom.</p> <p>Seeds I haven\u2019t grown for a few years \u2013 or ever \u2013 are next to go, though I save the mallow, larkspur, borage and salvia for Kala\u2019s garden.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to say it is liberating, but I know I\u2019ll likely never pass a rack of seed without feeling a greedy need to buy more. There is a large package of assorted flower and golden bacau bean seed on its way from a small co-op in Slovenia. For that, I blame the internet.</p> <p>There are potatoes chitting (Arran Pilot and Red Duke of York: both first earlies), ready to go in, and sweet peas growing in <a href=\"https://www.fernverrow.com/About%20us/\" title=\"\">Jane Scotter\u2019s</a> Hereford greenhouse.

That\u2019s true. But that\u2019s no argument for dismissing campaigns for free speech. The more we accept that speakers should be no-platformed because of their views, the less we will be able to challenge the kinds of censorship imposed through government programmes such as Prevent.</p> <p>So, yes, let\u2019s call out the hypocrisy of those who campaign for free speech but ignore the most egregious acts of censorship. Let\u2019s equally call out the hypocrisy of those who would highlight the chilling effects of Prevent but are willing to no-platform speakers whose views they deplore.

He said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia had risen to 74, including two members of the Australian defence force.</p> <p>He also commented on the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70?page=with:block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e#block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e\">an 82-year-old man in Sydney</a>, one of the residents of the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and the third person to die after testing positive to Covid-19 in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a great loss to him, his family, to all of the community, which will feel this loss,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p><strong>Hunt urged people to be \u201ctheir best selves\u201d</strong> in what seems to be an oblique reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">the toilet paper wars. </a></p> <p>\u201cOnly two months ago, as a nation, we faced the great challenge of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we rose. We were our best selves, and this is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail.<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd our job, working with the states and territory, but working with the community, is to make sure that we are not just prepared, but that we are unified.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so there have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves. But it was only two months ago, as I say, that as a country, the spirit of the volunteer, the spirit of the CFA and the RFS and our emergency service.\u201d</p> <p>Hunt returned to this point a lot, comparing the spirit required in response to the global coronavirus outbreak to that seen in response to the Australian bushfires. (You will recall the Australian government was heavily criticised for its management of that crisis.)</p> <p>He also announced that the Australian government had secured an additional 54m face masks for its national reserve and said that no primary health network in Australia had exhausted its first round of masks.</p> <p>So that means that, contrary to reports from GPs that they are struggling to get the appropriate personal protective equipment. Hunt said there may have been some miscommunications which meant that busy medical practices \u201cmay not have realised that they\u2019ve had that\u201d.</p> <p>Hunt was asked to comment on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">a spat unfolding in Victoria between the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, and GPs</a>, who were incensed at her comments that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d a GP who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 had gone to work with cold- and/or flu-like symptoms.</p> <p>Hunt drew on the bushfire analogy again: \u201cOver summer our firefighters and our emergency service workers were our heroes. In the coming months it will be our health and medical service workers who will be our national heroes. So we need to support them equally.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:44:35.737Z\">at 1.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e64463d8f085f0b8d944370\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:18:27.216Z\">1.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still in Australia, authorities are asking people who travelled on <strong>two flights between Canberra and Sydney on 28 February</strong> and sat in particular rows to self-isolate and call the public health line on 1300 066 055.</p> <p><strong>Flight one: 6.45am QF1509 Sydney to Canberra, rows 2-6</strong></p> <p><strong>Flight two: 2.35pm VA651 Canberra to Sydney, rows 3-7</strong></p> <p>\u201cAnyone else travelling on these flights in other rows are not considered to be close contacts and should monitor their health until 13 March and to contact their GP for assessment and testing if they develop any symptoms.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:45:44.897Z\">at 1.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6444718f085f0b8d944366\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:11:00.378Z\">1.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">44 new cases in China</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On Sunday health authorities in mainland China reported 44 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and 27 deaths (all in the Hubei province).

But it\u2019s not just Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership that have failed us: most metropolitan districts have Labour-controlled councils which, like mine in the London borough of Camden, have been shouting about the cuts to their budgets for years, without any attempt to bring this to public attention.</p> <p>If all the leaders of these councils had gone to Downing Street and demanded that the cuts be reversed, that might have stopped the disaster now unfolding.</p> <p>Labour MPs, especially those in more deprived areas, should have been saying that immigration is not the problem, and nor is the EU: the poverty is entirely the fault of the Tory austerity policies.

Such prospective backsliding is foolish, damaging and wholly unacceptable.</p> <p>The issue came to the fore last week after Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, revealed that the UK \u201cinforms us that they <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-brexit-human-rights-convention-echr-michel-barnier-a9378141.html\" title=\"\">do not wish to commit formally to applying the ECHR</a>\u201d. Downing Street later claimed that the government continued to support the treaty, which the UK joined in 1951, but did not want its membership to form a legally binding part of a future EU-UK trade agreement.</p> <p>This sounds like splitting hairs. But it is much more than that. The linking of trade agreements to human rights has become normal practice in recent years. As Barnier suggested, the ECHR provides essential legal underpinning in a range of areas. He highlighted cooperation in criminal justice and law enforcement, which, he said, \u201crequires commitment on both sides with respect to fundamental rights of persons\u201d.</p> <p>A UK refusal to guarantee future adherence to the treaty could have a potentially serious negative impact on the Good Friday agreement, to which it is integral. Security cooperation might also be affected, likewise arrangements regarding privacy and the safeguarding of personal data. Barnier warned, rightly, that the British position, if maintained, will severely handicap and limit the scope of the future EU-UK relationship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rightwing Tories have long disparaged the ECHR, seeing it as a tool employed by scheming Brussels bureaucrats</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is Boris Johnson playing at? Or perhaps this question should be directed at Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, who is on record as wanting rid of the ECHR altogether. Rightwing Tories have long disparaged the treaty and the 1998 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk-human-rights-act-is-at-risk-of-repeal-heres-why-it-should-be-protected-111368\" title=\"\">Human Rights Act</a> that translated it into British law, seeing them as tools employed by scheming Brussels bureaucrats to extend control over British life.</p> <p>This has always been an absurd argument. The <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/what-is-the-european-convention-on-human-rights\" title=\"\">ECHR</a>, and its associated court in Strasbourg, came into being long before the modern-day EU, and is entirely separate from it. It is the creation of the 47-country <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/who-we-are\" title=\"\">Council of Europe</a> that Winston Churchill, Johnson\u2019s hero, helped found. In 1948, Churchill called for a \u201ccharter of human rights guarded by freedom and sustained by law\u201d.</p> <p>The ECHR is, in fact, an achievement of which Britain should be particularly proud. Reacting to the horrors of the Second World War, the treaty aimed to ensure that governments would never again be allowed to abuse ordinary people with impunity. Its development helped inform the UN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/28/un-adopts-universal-declaration-human-rights-paris-1948\" title=\"\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. British experts helped draft it. The UK was first to ratify it. And it has been hugely influential in setting or raising standards in Europe and around the world.</p> <p>Despite his insistence that Britain will remain a signatory, Johnson\u2019s refusal to fully commit to abiding by the ECHR in EU negotiations strongly suggests that he may seek, in future, to <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-next-target-in-the-project-to-take-back-control-strasbourg-and-the-human-rights-act-brexit-law-constitution\" title=\"\">abrogate it</a> (and the HRA) entirely \u2013 as ideologues such as Cummings demand. This would do huge damage to Britain\u2019s standing in the world and its hard-won reputation as a leading advocate for global human rights.</p> <p>More than that, it represents a fundamental threat to the rights of British people, who, unlike in many democracies, are not protected by written constitutional guarantees or a modern bill of rights. If the UK abandoned the ECHR, it would join Belarus, an authoritarian dictatorship that is the only country in Europe not a party to it. Even Vladimir Putin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/CP_Russia_ENG.pdf\" title=\"\">Russia</a> has been a member since 1998.</p> <p>With international laws and institutions such as the international criminal court being vandalised and undermined by autocrats and demagogues such as Donald Trump, this is not the time to start messing with British citizens\u2019 basic legal protections.
